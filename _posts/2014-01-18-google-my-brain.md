title: Google my brain
---
So, I just updated my personal home page to include a blogging section. I have no plans on starting a career as blogger - but I got inspired at the recent Warm Crocodile Developer Conference, which I attended, when Scott Hanselman used the term "Google my brain". It's simple: every time you use more than 10 minutes on doing some kind of research, then write a blog post about it afterwards, enabling you to "Google your brain" afterwards.

For now the purpose of this domain is primarily to expose myself! :) Furthermore I have uploaded some of the papers and notes I have created during my 5 and a half years of education.
